#### Contributing

1. Make a feature branch: __git checkout -b your-username/your-feature__
2. Follow Terraform Style Guide
3. Make your feature. Keep things tidy so you have one commit per self-contained change (squashing can help).
4. Push your branch: __git push -u origin your-username/your-feature__
5. Open GitHub to the repo,
   under "Your recently pushed branches", click __Pull Request__ for
   _your-username/your-feature_.

Be sure to use a separate feature branch and pull request for every
self-contained feature.  If you need to make changes from feedback, make
the changes in place rather than layering on commits (use interactive
rebase to edit your earlier commits).  Then use __git push --force
origin your-feature__ to update your pull request.
